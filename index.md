**1. What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**

The most interesting topic covered in my domain this quarter was how we are able to use time series in order to help patients understand their overall health and all the possible ways to further that effort. I didn't realize how much data was available through our wearables and how much insights can be gathered using those time series data. 

**2. Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**

A potential investigation that I would like to pursue for my Quarter 2 Project is finding out how to create secure login systems. This will greatly help us scale our website later if we wanted to. 

**3. What is a potential change you'd make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**

One potential change I would make to the approach taken in my current Quarter 1 Project is to stop trying to overplan everything and just get down to doing it. I feel like this quarter, I spent too much time thinking about what to do and didn't spend enough time actually doing. 

**4. What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**

One other technique that I would be interested in using in my project is a Chat-GPT plug-in. We were interested in adding a chat-bot feature to our website so the patients can get better insights into their data and what it can mean.
